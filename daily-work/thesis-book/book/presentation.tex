\section*{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item C.elegans: how are them, why are they being used.
\item Problem: too many to fit them manually -> automated solution
\item Endrov: Particularly at the karolinska institute they will
  like it. Endrov intents to be next standard
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item General Objective
\item Specific Objectives
\end{itemize}

\section*{Background}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tracking
\item Not tracking
\item Cluster problems. Trackers attempt to solve it through
  large data sets. Not trackers with sets of one image. High
  percentage, never total.
\item Segm-Sk-Parameterization
\item Optimization varies
\end{itemize}

\section*{Methodology}

\subsection*{Reasoning}
%reasoning Big Image
\begin{itemize}
\item Image must be segmented in order to separate the individual
  worms as much as possible. The image can be divided into object
  pixels and background pixels.
\item The endpoints of the worms must be detected/identified. A skeleton
  is calculated that traces a thin path between endpoints.
\item We separate the worms into two classes: isolated worms, and 
  worm clusters.
\item The shape of the isolated worms can be identified easily.
\item On the other hand, worm clusters require a matching process
  in order to fit the clustered worms.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item This requires a shape descriptor. 
  \item Worm Shape Rasterization
  \item And match optimization method
    \item The optimization method will consist in constructing a generic
      shape given a profile and a worm path, and deforming that shape
      until a best match is found.
  \end{itemize}
\item Incorrect matched can be fixed manually

\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Individual Explanation}

\begin{itemize}
\item First a thresholding algorithm calculates a binary image dividing
  in object and background pixels. The object pixels are those belonging
  to a worm shape.
  Noise is removed as much as possible.
\item A distance map is calculated that allow us to obtain the shortest
  distance to the background. Is used as a tool
  to trace contour, automatic generation of shape
  descriptors and skeletonzation among others.
\item The skeleton is calculated. This is a connected thin path that tends
to represent the medial axis. Endpoints can be calculated as the extreme 
of the worms. 
\item Division isolated and cluster worms.
\item Isolated: easily traceable. Finding the 
closest contour pixel and following it.
\item Cluster: Construct a generic worm shape around
a medial axis and deform it until the more likely
worm shape is found.\\ 
For that we need a shape descriptor, a rasterization
method and distance measure between the matching 
model and the image.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Shape descriptor: A profile can be calculated
from isolated worms.\\
A series of even distance control points are
calculated from the skeleton path. Given the profile
the contour points are calculated by finding the 
intersection between the bisectors and the 
thickness circle. A cardinal spline is used to 
trace the contour.
\item Rasterization is done with ear clipping and
triangle rasterization.
\item Optimization
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Deformation
  \item Energy formulation.
  \item Conformations between every logical 
    pair of endpoints
  \item Assignment algorithm
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Manual Manipulation: Wrong conformations
  can be fixed
\item Endpoints as well.
\end{itemize}
